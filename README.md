## Installation

Before you can dive into the world of Snake, you'll need to install Pygame, the game development library we used for this project. 
You can do this effortlessly with pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

Once Pygame is installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mathis003/Snake-Game.git
```

## Usage

Now that you have everything set up, let's get started with some Snake action. 
Run the game by executing the main.py file:

```bash
python main.py
```

Controlling the snake is easy, just use your arrow keys to navigate through the game world and eat those tasty apples.
